# OpenClaw Agent Development Rules

## Core Philosophy
- **Framework:** We are building autonomous OpenClaw agents, NOT a standard web app.
- **Identity:** Agents are defined in `SOUL.md` (personality/system prompt).
- **Capabilities:** Tools are defined in `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter + TypeScript implementation.
- **Memory:** Context is stored in `MEMORY.md` (long-term) and JSONL logs (short-term).
- **Execution:** Agents run via the OpenClaw Gateway, not as standalone Node scripts.

## File Structure Standards
- `~/.openclaw/agents/{agent_name}/SOUL.md` -> The Agent's brain.
- `~/.openclaw/skills/{skill_name}/SKILL.md` -> The Tool definition.
- `src/ingest/` -> specialized TypeScript scripts for data processing.
- `data/` -> Local storage for CSVs and JSONL files (gitignored).

## Coding Constraints
1. **No "Chatbot" UIs:** We are building background workers. Do not suggest React frontends.
2. **Schema First:** All extraction (Review -> Insight) must be validated against `src/schemas/*.schema.json`.
3. **Local First:** Prefer local file operations (fs) over database calls for the MVP.
4. **Token Efficiency:** Always calculate and log token usage for every LLM call.

## Context
Always refer to @BLUEPRINT.md for the master plan and phase objectives.
