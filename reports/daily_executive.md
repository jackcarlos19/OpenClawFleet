## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Address critical inventory shortage of SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro"
2. Adjust marketing strategy to align with inventory constraints
3. Optimize campaign for SKU-102 "Night-Shift" while monitoring stock levels

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Customer Report proposes new creative campaigns targeting healthcare and warehouse workers, but SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" is at critical stock levels (5 days) requiring immediate ad pause.

Additional Risks:
- SKU-102 "Night-Shift" inventory approaching warning levels (12 days)
- Potential brand impact if we launch campaigns without adequate stock to fulfill demand

### Recommended Decisions Today
1. IMMEDIATE: Pause all advertising for SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" until inventory levels recover (Owner: Marketing Director)
2. URGENT: Expedite purchase order for SKU-101 with target of 30-day safety stock (Owner: Supply Chain)
3. TODAY: Redirect creative team to focus on brand awareness content rather than direct response until inventory stabilizes (Owner: Creative Director)
4. THIS WEEK: Develop contingency creative plan that can flexibly adapt to inventory levels, particularly for SKU-102 which is showing early warning signs (Owner: Marketing Strategy)

Note: While the customer insights provide excellent creative direction for future campaigns, implementation should be delayed until inventory issues are resolved to avoid customer disappointment and negative brand impact.
