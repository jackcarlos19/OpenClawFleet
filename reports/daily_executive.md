## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Immediate inventory crisis management for SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro"
2. Strategic ad spend reallocation due to low stock levels
3. Implementation of new healthcare worker targeting campaign (pending inventory resolution)

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Customer Report proposes new ad creative and campaign scaling while Inventory Report indicates critical stock levels requiring ad pauses:
- SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" at only 5 days of stock
- SKU-102 "Night-Shift" at 12 days of stock
Both products need reduced visibility, not increased promotion.

### Recommended Decisions Today
1. IMMEDIATE: Pause all advertising for SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" and reduce SKU-102 "Night-Shift" ad spend by 50% (Owner: Marketing Director, Today)
2. URGENT: Expedite purchase orders for both SKUs with priority on SKU-101, targeting 30-day minimum stock levels (Owner: Supply Chain Manager, Today)
3. HOLD: Delay launch of new healthcare worker creative campaign until inventory levels stabilize to minimum 21 days of stock (Owner: Creative Director)
4. PREPARE: Development team to create landing pages with email capture for "notify when back in stock" to maintain customer interest during low-stock period (Owner: Digital Team, Next 48 hours)

Note: The strong creative direction from the Customer Report should be preserved but timed for launch only after inventory stabilizes to prevent customer disappointment and maintain brand trust.
