## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Address critical inventory shortage of SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro"
2. Realign marketing strategy with inventory constraints
3. Optimize SKU-102 "Night-Shift" promotion strategy given warning stock levels

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Customer Report proposes aggressive marketing campaigns for healthcare/retail workers while our main comfort shoe line (SKU-101) is at critical stock levels requiring immediate ad pause.

Additional Risks:
- Both primary SKUs (101 & 102) are under inventory pressure while VoC data suggests strong market demand
- Marketing creative is ready for major push exactly when we need to pull back

### Recommended Decisions Today
1. IMMEDIATE: Pause all ad campaigns for SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" until inventory levels recover (Owner: Marketing)
2. TODAY: Expedite PO for SKU-101 with supplier, requesting split shipments if possible (Owner: Procurement)
3. BY EOD: Revise creative brief to focus on SKUs with healthy inventory levels or delay campaign launch until stock recovers (Owner: Creative Team)
4. NEXT 48 HRS: Develop contingency marketing plan focusing on lead capture and waitlist building rather than immediate sales conversion (Owner: Marketing Strategy)
