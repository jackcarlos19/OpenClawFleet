## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Immediate inventory crisis management for Comfort-Pro (SKU-101)
2. Strategic ad spend reallocation from low-stock products
3. Launch new creative focusing on Night-Shift while Comfort-Pro restocks

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: Customer Report suggests new ad creative push for healthcare/retail workers, but inventory shows critical stock levels for main products:
- Comfort-Pro at only 5 days of stock
- Night-Shift at warning level (12 days)
Running new ad campaigns now could accelerate stockout risk.

### Recommended Decisions Today
1. IMMEDIATE: Pause all advertising for Comfort-Pro (SKU-101) and reduce Night-Shift (SKU-102) ad spend by 50% [Marketing, Today]
2. URGENT: Expedite PO for Comfort-Pro with supplier, requesting split shipments if possible [Procurement, Today]
3. PIVOT: Delay launch of new creative campaigns until inventory stabilizes, estimated 2-3 weeks [Creative Team]
4. CONTINGENCY: Prepare customer service response plan for potential Comfort-Pro stockout scenario [Customer Service, 48hrs]
5. ANALYTICS: Set up daily sales velocity monitoring for Night-Shift to prevent it reaching critical levels [Analytics Team, 24hrs]

Note: While the customer insights provide excellent creative direction for future campaigns, implementing these now would create significant inventory risks. Recommend holding these assets until stock levels normalize.
