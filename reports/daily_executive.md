## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Address critical inventory shortage of SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro"
2. Realign marketing strategy with inventory constraints
3. Optimize SKU-102 "Night-Shift" promotion strategy while monitoring stock levels

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Customer Report proposes new creative campaigns targeting healthcare and warehouse workers, but SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" is at critical stock levels (5 days) requiring immediate ad pause.

Additional Risks:
- SKU-102 "Night-Shift" inventory approaching warning levels (12 days)
- Potential brand impact if we can't fulfill demand generated by new creative campaigns

### Recommended Decisions Today
1. IMMEDIATE: Pause all advertising for SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" until inventory levels recover (Owner: Marketing Director)
2. TODAY: Expedite purchase order for SKU-101 with supplier, requesting priority processing (Owner: Supply Chain Manager)
3. BY EOD: Revise creative brief implementation timeline to align with expected inventory recovery dates (Owner: Creative Director)
4. NEXT 48 HRS: Develop contingency promotion plan focusing on SKU-102, but with controlled spending to prevent stockout (Owner: Marketing Manager)
5. THIS WEEK: Increase safety stock levels for both SKUs to prevent future critical situations (Owner: Inventory Manager)

Note: While the creative brief shows promising angles for healthcare and warehouse workers, implementation should be delayed until inventory stabilizes to avoid customer disappointment and potential brand damage.
