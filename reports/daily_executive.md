## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Address critical inventory shortage of SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro"
2. Adjust marketing strategy to align with inventory constraints
3. Optimize campaign for SKU-102 "Night-Shift" while monitoring stock levels

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Customer Report proposes new creative campaigns targeting healthcare and warehouse workers, but SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" is at critical stock levels (5 days) requiring immediate ad pause.

Additional Risks:
- SKU-102 "Night-Shift" inventory approaching warning levels (12 days)
- Potential brand impact if we launch campaigns without adequate stock to fulfill demand

### Recommended Decisions Today
1. IMMEDIATE: Pause all advertising for SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" until inventory levels recover (Owner: Marketing Director)
2. URGENT: Expedite purchase order for SKU-101 with target of 30-day safety stock (Owner: Supply Chain)
3. BY EOD: Redirect creative team to focus on brand awareness content rather than direct response until inventory stabilizes (Owner: Creative Director)
4. NEXT 48 HRS: Develop contingency marketing plan focusing on SKUs with healthy inventory levels while maintaining presence in healthcare/warehouse worker segments (Owner: Marketing Strategy)

Note: While the creative brief contains strong angles and hooks for the target audience, implementation should be delayed until inventory issues are resolved to avoid customer disappointment and potential negative brand impact.
