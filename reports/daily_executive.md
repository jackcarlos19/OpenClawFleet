## Daily Executive Briefing

### Top 3 Priorities
1. Immediate inventory crisis management for Comfort-Pro (SKU-101)
2. Strategic ad spend reallocation from low-stock products
3. Launch new creative targeting healthcare workers while preserving inventory

### Conflicts & Risks
CRITICAL CONFLICT: Customer Report suggests aggressive marketing to healthcare workers while SKU-101 "Comfort-Pro" is at critical inventory levels (5 days) with recommendation to pause ads.

Additional Risks:
- SKU-102 "Night-Shift" approaching warning levels (12 days)
- Current creative strategy could accelerate stockout risk

### Recommended Decisions Today

   Owner: Marketing Director
   Timeline: Today

2. URGENT: Expedite PO for SKU-101 with supplier
   Owner: Supply Chain Manager
   Timeline: Within 24 hours

3. PIVOT: Modify creative rollout to focus on SKUs with healthy inventory levels
   Owner: Creative Director
   Timeline: Next 48 hours

4. PREPARE: Develop contingency messaging for potential stockout scenario
   Owner: Communications Team

Note: While the customer insights provide excellent creative direction for healthcare workers, we must temporarily hold this campaign until inventory stabilizes to avoid customer disappointment and negative brand impact.
